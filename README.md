CrystalCollector Game

jQuery Assignment
Overview
The Crystal Collector is a fun and interactive game for web browsers. This app dynamically update the HTML pages with the jQuery library.

Here's how the app works:
There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When you click on a crystal, your score counter is updated.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
